You may find that incorporating additional information such as annotations on the genome (locations of genes, regulatory regions, transcription binding sites, etc.) helps your prediction task.

ENCODE is an example of such source of information, and the file containing locations of known human transcription factor bindings sites are given in this directory. You can download additional data from ENCODE:

as well as many other sources.

Specifically, the file in this directory was obtained from:
